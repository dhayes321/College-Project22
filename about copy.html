                The daily work of the manager is filled with one-on-one or group interactions focused on operations. 
                Many managers use early mornings or later evenings to complete their reports, 
                catch up on email, and update their task lists. 
                There is never a dull moment, much less time for 
                quiet contemplation, in the lives of most managers. 
                Managers are most often responsible for a particular function or department within the organization. 
                From accounting to marketing, to sales, customer support, engineering, quality, and all other groups, 
                a manager either directly leads his or her team or leads a group of supervisors who oversee the teams of employees.
                The phrase “span of control” relates to the number of individuals who report directly to any particular manager. 
                Various trends have existed over the years, but the current approach to creating a proper span of control in an organization involves an analysis of what the organization and its employees need. <a href="https://www.thebalancecareers.com/what-is-a-manager-2276096" >More Info</a>
